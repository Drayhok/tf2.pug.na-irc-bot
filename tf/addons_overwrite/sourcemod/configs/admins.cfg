/**
 * USE THIS SECTION TO DECLARE DETAILED ADMIN PROPERTIES.
 *
 * Each admin should have its own "Admin" section, followed by a name.
 * The name does not have to be unique.
 *
 * Available properties: (Anything else is filtered as custom)
 *      "auth"          - REQUIRED - Auth method to use.  Built-in methods are:
 *                        "steam"  - Steam based authentication
 *                        "name"   - Name based authentication
 *                        "ip"	- IP based authentication
 *                        Anything else is treated as custom.
 *					 Note: Only one auth method is allowed per entry.
 *
 *      "identity"      - REQUIRED - Identification string, for example, a steamid or name.
 *					 Note: Only one identity is allowed per entry.
 *
 *      "password"      - Optional password to require.

 *      "flags"         - Adds one or more flags to the user's permissions.
 *		"immunity"		- Sets the user's immunity level (0 = no immunity).
 *						  Immunity can be any value.  Admins with higher 
 *						  values cannot be targetted.  See sm_immunity_mode 
 *						  to tweak the rules.  Default value is 0.
 *
 * Example:
	"BAILOPAN"
	{
		"auth"			"steam"
		"identity"		"STEAM_0:1:16"
		"flags"			"abcdef"
	}
