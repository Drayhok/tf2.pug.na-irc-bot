//
// This is an example tournament mode item whitelist. Rename the file to item_whitelist.txt to allow the game to find it.
// Note that the whitelist is loaded on map start, and only if mp_tournament is 1, so you'll need to change maps if you enable 
// mp_tournament after the map has loaded.
// 
// If the game finds the whitelist file, all non-base TF items are marked as illegal. 
// Only item definitions listed in the whitelist file become legal.
// To find a list of definition names, use the "item_show_whitelistable_definitions" command.
// 
// Format:
//		<Item Definition Name>			"1"
//		<Item Definition Name>			"1"
//		...
